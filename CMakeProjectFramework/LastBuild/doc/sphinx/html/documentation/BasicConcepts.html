<span id="basicconcepts"></span><h1>Basic Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This pages describes the general ideas behind the <em>CMakeProjectFramework</em>.
It introduces some terms that are used throughout the documentation of this
project.</p>
<section id="concepts">
<h2>Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CPF follows the following key concepts.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Provide a <a class="reference internal" href="#multirepositoryapproach"><span class="std std-ref">multi repository approach</span></a> that allows the distribution
of the code base over multiple repositories.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the build infrastructure completely in text-files that can be
held in a repository. This allows to quickly set up the infrastructure from a small
amount of data. The repository also provides the change history for the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Hide all CMake features behind a smaller declarative interface. While cmake offers
the functionality to solve all problems that occur when setting up a C++ code-base,
it is still quite some work to implement a solution. The CPF wants to take that burden
from its users, while trying not to loose too much of the generality that a custom
implementation would offer.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep files of three different live expectancies in three different directories.
Sources, Configurations and generated files. Keeping the generated files out of the source-tree
has become the norm when using CMake. This allows deleting the <em>build-tree</em> in order
to guarantee a fresh system. However, in the standard CMake workflow, the generated files
also contain the manually defined project configuration within the <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMakeCache.txt</span></code> file.
For complex projects, defining a configuration may take some time and deleting it together
with the generated files is undesirable. The <em>CPF</em> therefore puts the configuration information
in a directory that is parallel to the <em>build-</em> and <em>source-tree</em>. It also allows defining multiple
configurations at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the build system handle parallelism and up-to-date checks. The <em>CPF</em> takes advantage of <em>CMake’s</em> custom target
mechanism. This way the advanced tasks like test-runs, code-analysis or documentation generation
may be run in parallel and are only re-run when they are outdated.</p></li>
<li><p>Separate the CI-code from the production code by putting it into
the CI-project repository. Read more in <a class="reference internal" href="#ciprojectandpackageprojects"><span class="std std-ref">CI Project vs. Package Projects</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="ci-project-vs-package-projects">
<span id="ciprojectandpackageprojects"></span><h3>CI Project vs. Package Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#ci-project-vs-package-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In a CPF project, the code that implements the CI-job is separated from the <em>payload</em> code.
The <em>payload</em> code can be split up into multiple packages.</p>
<p>To achieve this, a CPF project has two CMake project levels. The CI project is created in the root <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMakeLists.txt</span></code> file. It provides
the interface for the CI-job and the developers to build a set of packages and defines which configurations are build by the CI-system.
The project repository can also contain some higher level documentation that does not really belong to a single
package, but rather the group of packages that is <em>owned</em> by the CI project.</p>
<p>In the <em>Sources</em> subdirectory we have the package directories that contain the <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMakeLists.txt</span></code> files that define the package
projects. Each package creates one main binary that is supposed to be used by consumers. This can be a library or an executable.
The package can also contain other arbitrary files like test-code, image resources, documentation and everything else that
belongs to that piece of functionality.</p>
</section>
<section id="multi-repository-approach">
<span id="multirepositoryapproach"></span><h3>Multi Repository Approach<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-repository-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For small code bases it is practical to keep all files in a single repository.
This avoids version conflicts and keeps the project nice and simple.
This means however, that a change in a a lower lever library must always be
<em>pulled through</em> for all components that use the library. A change in one <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.cpp</span></code> file
will always trigger the build-job for the <em>whole world</em>. One can imagine that this
does not scale for a growing code-base.</p>
<p>The CPF therefore supports splitting up the code-base into multiple repositories
and multiple build-jobs. A CPF project can be started with the simple single repository and single build-job
approach and later be split up in multiple repositories and multiple build-jobs.
One should be aware though, that this introduces a noticeable increase in complexity.
The <em>git work</em> will increase and and version conflicts become possible.</p>
<p>Each CI-project repository defines a CI-build-job for multiple packages, and each package
can have its own repository which is recommended for packages that are consumed by multiple
CI-projects.</p>

<section id="package-ownership">
<span id="packageownership"></span><h3>Package Ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#package-ownership" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A package can be owned by a CI project or be an external package. If a package is owned by a CI project it means, that this
CI project is responsible for running the automated tests of the package and defining the officially supported build configurations
of that the package. When using the CPFMachines CI-job, it will also be the entity that marks successful builds of owned packages
with version tags. An owned package can either be included in the CI projects git repository, or it can be a git submodule with
its own repository. If it uses a git submodule it is called a <em>loose owned package</em>. In this case it’s version number can advance independently
of the CI-repository. Packages that are intended to be used in other projects, should be <em>loose</em> packages with their own
repository to allow other projects to include the package as a git submodule. <em>Loose</em> packages lead to more and more complex <em>git work</em>,
meaning that more git operations will be necessary in the day to day work.
If packages are executables or not used in other projects, it is therefore recommended to make them <em>fixed</em> packages and check them
directly into the CI repository.</p>
<p>External packages are always git submodules. The CI project’s build-pipeline will not run the tests for these packages and exclude
them when generating the documentation. An external project should have another CI project that owns that package.</p>
