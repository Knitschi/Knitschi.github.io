
Manual Tests
============

This is a list of non automated tests. This should only be a stopgap solution until
they are automated.

Tests for versioning mechanics
------------------------------

- Running a successful build for an already pushed commit without a version tag should add an internl version tag to that commit.
- Setting a release version tag should only work when the build is run on an internal version tag.
- It should not be possible to create a release version tag that already exists.
- When createin a release version, the old internal version tag should be deleted.
- Owned packages should be updated during the job run if new commits are available.
- The job should fail when release tagging a non owned package
