
Automatic build-Job execution
=============================

In day to day development it is practical when the build-job is run automatically whenever a developer
pushes commits that should be integrated into a main branch of the project. To enable that CPFJenkinsjob
provides a python module that adds hook scripts to the repositories of your CPF-projects.

.. todo:: Add documentation for hook config and how to run it.
