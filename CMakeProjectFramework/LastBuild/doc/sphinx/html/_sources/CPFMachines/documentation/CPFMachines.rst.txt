CPFMachines
===========

The CPF infrastructure includes a Jenkins server, build slaves and web-servers for hosting the generated html pages.
This package provides a python script for setting up these servers. The setup script requires a user provided configuration file
and ssh access to all involved machines in the network.

The jenkins server can be configured to contain build-jobs for CPF based repositories. For each of these projects, a web-server
is set up to host the html content that is generated by the CPF-projects build pipeline.

CPFMachines also provides a python script to deploy post-receive hooks to the cpf-project repositories.

\warning From all the packages in the CMakeProjectFramework CPFMachines is the least seasoned one.
Users still have to do a lot of manual work like setting up ssh servers and manual installation of
build-tools on the windows build-slaves.
