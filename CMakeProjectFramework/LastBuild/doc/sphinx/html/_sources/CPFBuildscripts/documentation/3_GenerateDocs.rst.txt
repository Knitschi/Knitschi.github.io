
3_Generate.py
=============

This script runs the CMake generate step that creates the native "make files" for you chosen generator.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  Usage:
      3_Generate.py [<config_name>] [--clean] [--help]

      Running this script will run CMake to generate the "make-files" for the given
      configuration. <config_name> must be the base-name of a configuration file
      found in the "Configuration" sub-directory. After calling this script,
      the makefiles can be found in the "Generated/<config-name> sub-directory.
      When the <config_name> is given, an possibly existing "Generated/<config-name>"
      directory will be deleted before running CMake. If the <config_name> option
      is not given, the script will choose the first available config in the
      "Configuration" directory. It will also not delete the "Generated/<config-name>"
      directory, so this can be used for running CMake incrementally.
      Note that when calling this for the first time, this step will download and
      compile all dependencies that are handled with the hunter package manager,
      so the execution may take some time.

  Options:
      -c --clean              Deletes the Generated/<config_name> directory before 
                              running CMake to get a clean build-tree.
      -h --help               Shows this page.
