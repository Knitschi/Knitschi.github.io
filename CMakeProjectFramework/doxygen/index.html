<div class="textblock"><h1>The CMakeProjectFramework</h1>
<p>The <b>CMakeProjectFramework</b> framework provides a solution for organizing a cross-platform Git and CMake based C++ software project. At the low level it implements the execution of additional tasks like test-execution, packaging or documentation generation. This part is implemented with CMake and can be used without the higher level part, which implements a Jenkins based CI-infrastructure that can be used to provide continuous integration services for a CPF project.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This project is work in progress. Currently there are no automated tests that guarantee it to be in a working condition.</dd></dl>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When setting up a C++ Software project multiple tasks besides writing the actual C++ code arise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing the code-base into smaller packages.</li>
<li>Versioning of the packages.</li>
<li>Automatic acquisition of external software dependencies.</li>
<li>Setting up a build pipeline that also does additional tasks like running automated test, static/dynamic analysis, generate documentation, etc.</li>
<li>Setting up a CI-server to run the pipeline.</li>
<li>Setting up a homepage for the project that hosts the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CMakeProjectFramework tries to solve the above mentioned problems by using a combination of common open source tools from the C++ ecosystem. The third party tools used by the CMakeProjectFramework are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> (code versioning)</li>
<li><a href="https://cmake.org/download/">CMake</a> (meta-buildsystem)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruslo/hunter">Hunter package manager</a> (automatic dependency retrieval)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sakra/cotire">Cotire</a> (CMake module for pre-compiled headers)</li>
<li><a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> (CI server)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a> (documentation generator)</li>
<li><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/">clang-tidy</a> (static code analysis)</li>
<li><a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> (dynamic code analysis)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage">OpenCppCoverage</a> (measure test coverage)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lvc/abi-compliance-checker">Abi Compliance Checker</a> (visualize changes in the API/ABI between package versions)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> (used to create a dependency graph of the project)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the <b>CPF</b> should relieve you of writing your own higher level CMake code or other additional scripts to implement pipeline tasks. It can additionally provide a Jenkins CI infrastructure that is (in the future) completely generated from text-files.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>In the smaller sized teams and companies that I have worked with, improving the CI system was often a somewhat neglected part of the development. Although the eco-system provides a number of open source tools that do the heavy lifting, it is still quite some work to integrate all the tools into a full featured CI production system. Implementing new features often had higher priority then the work on the infrastructure. In the worst case this meant that the team had to work without a CI server or that the CI server only did the most basic jobs like building and packaging the project.</p>
<p>This situation bugged me and I started to implement a CI pipeline and infrastructure for my own C++ toy code-base. At some point the <em>project</em> code started to get bigger then the C++ <em>payload</em> code. I decided to pull out that <em>project</em> code into its own repository which now has become the <b>CMakeProjectFramework</b>.</p>
<p>At its current state the project is not battle tested. As far as I know I am the only user and the project currently lacks the generality to be useful to everybody. However, I am interested in changing that and making the project useful to hobby developers or small teams that have not yet a CI pipeline in place. If you are interested in using the project or joining its development, feel free to contact me via Github.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The CMakeProjectFramework is currently only developed on Linux and Windows. In the long run I would also like to support development on MacOS, and cross-compiling to any other platform that is supported by CMake.</li>
<li>Setting up the CI infrastructure currently requires still a lot of manual work.</li>
<li>I do not know if <em>custom</em> pipeline steps can be easily added to the pipeline.</li>
<li>When using the <b>CPF</b> on windows, one can easily run into the 260 character limit for filesystem paths. If this is hit, the only fix is to reduce the length of package names and the project name.</li>
</ol>
